            <ol>
                <li>Cut the meat from the beef bones into about 1/2 inch pieces, leaving some on the bones.</li>
                <br/>
                <li>Heat a heavy soup pot over medium-high heat until very hot. Add oil, tilting the pan to coat the bottom.
                    Add meat and bones and season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until thoroughly browned.</li>
                <br/>
                <li>Add onion and cook until lightly browned; stir in broth and tomatoes. 
                    The liquid should cover the bones by 1/2 inch. If not, add some water to compensate. 
                    Reduce heat to low; simmer with the lid on loosely until meat is tender, about 1 hour.</li>
                <br/>
                <li>Pour in 4 cups water, and return to a simmer. Add carrots and 1/4 cup cilantro, and cook for 10 minutes. 
                    Stir in chayote, corn, and potato; simmer until vegetables are tender. Push cabbage wedges into soup; cook until tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <br/>
                <li>Ladle soup into large bowls, including some meat, vegetables, and bones. Garnish with cilantro, jalapeños, and minced onion.
                    Squeeze lime juice over soup and serve with radishes.</li>
